## Angular 20 Support

NGXS v20 adds full support for Angular 20, ensuring that you can use the latest Angular features with our state management solution. This update maintains compatibility with the Angular ecosystem and takes advantage of the latest improvements in the framework ([PR #2342](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2342)).

## ActionDirector

One of the most exciting new features in this release is the `ActionDirector` service, which provides a powerful way to attach and detach action handlers dynamically ([PR #2329](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2329)).

You can find detailed documentation on this feature in our [Dynamic Action Handlers](http://ngxs.io/concepts/actions/dynamic-action-handlers) guide.

The `ActionDirector` allows you to:

- Add action handlers conditionally based on runtime conditions
- Add action handlers for lazy-loaded modules
- Create temporary action handlers that can be removed later

Here's an example of how to use the `ActionDirector`:

```ts
import { ActionDirector, createSelector } from '@ngxs/store';
import { inject, Injectable } from '@angular/core';

// State token
const COUNTRIES_STATE_TOKEN = new StateToken<string[]>('countries');

// Action
export class AddCountry {
  static readonly type = '[Countries] Add Country';
  constructor(public country: string) {}
}

@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class CountryService {
  private actionDirector = inject(ActionDirector);
  private handle: { detach: () => void } | null = null;

  // Attach the action handler
  attachCountryHandler() {
    if (this.handle) return; // Already attached

    this.handle = this.actionDirector.attachAction(
      COUNTRIES_STATE_TOKEN,
      AddCountry,
      (ctx, action) => {
        // Update state
        ctx.setState(countries => [...countries, action.country]);
      }
    );
  }

  // Detach the action handler when no longer needed
  detachCountryHandler() {
    if (this.handle) {
      this.handle.detach();
      this.handle = null;
    }
  }
}
```

This feature is particularly useful for plugin systems, lazy-loaded features, temporary behaviors, and conditional action handling.

## lazyProvider Utility

The new `lazyProvider` utility function helps you defer the registration of Angular providers until they are explicitly needed ([PR #2326](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2326)). This is especially valuable for feature state libraries, preventing them from being unnecessarily included in the initial application bundle.

You can find this feature documented in our [Lazy Loaded States](http://ngxs.io/concepts/state/lazy) guide.

```ts
import { lazyProvider } from '@ngxs/store';

const routes = [
  {
    path: 'invoices',
    loadComponent: () =>
      import('./invoices/invoices.component').then(m => m.InvoicesComponent),
    canActivate: [
      lazyProvider(async () => (await import('./states/invoices')).invoicesStateProvider)
    ]
  }
];
```

In your state library, you can export a provider:

```ts
// states/invoices.ts
export const invoicesStateProvider = provideStates([InvoicesState]);

// OR using default export
export default provideStates([InvoicesState]);
```

This approach reduces your initial bundle size and ensures that state providers are only loaded when they're actually needed.

## DevTools Plugin Serialization

The DevTools plugin now includes a `serialize` option, allowing for more customized state serialization when working with the Redux DevTools ([PR #2337](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2337)). This feature helps you handle complex state objects or circular references that might cause issues when inspecting state in the DevTools.

The `serialize` option provides control over how your state is displayed and manipulated in the Redux DevTools extension, making debugging and time-traveling easier with complex state structures. For more information, see our [Redux DevTools Plugin](http://ngxs.io/plugins/devtools) documentation.

## DestroyRef Modernization

We've replaced traditional `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hooks with Angular's `DestroyRef` throughout the codebase ([PR #2289](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2289)). This modernization improves memory management and makes our code more aligned with Angular's recommended practices for handling component and service destruction.

## Reduced RxJS Dependency

NGXS v20 continues our efforts to reduce reliance on RxJS by:

- Pulling fewer RxJS symbols ([PR #2309](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2309), [PR #2310](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2310))
- Replacing operators with more efficient implementations
- Optimizing how we handle observable streams ([PR #2292](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2292))

These changes result in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance, especially for applications that don't heavily use RxJS elsewhere.

## Bug Fixes

We've addressed several important issues in this release:

- Added root store initializer guard to prevent initialization issues ([PR #2278](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2278))
- Reduced change detection cycles with pending tasks ([PR #2280](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2280))
- Completed action results on destroy to prevent memory leaks ([PR #2282](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2282))
- Completed `dispatched$` in internal actions ([PR #2285](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2285))
- Stopped contributing to stability once app is stable ([PR #2306](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2306))
- Improved server-side rendering (SSR) support with `ngServerMode` ([PR #2287](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2287), [PR #2288](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2288))

## Plugin Improvements

### Form Plugin

- Replaced `takeUntil` with `takeUntilDestroyed` for better cleanup ([PR #2283](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2283))

### Router Plugin

- Reduced RxJS dependency for better performance ([PR #2291](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2291))
- Changed `@Selector` to `createSelector` for better type safety and tree-shaking ([PR #2294](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2294))

### DevTools Plugin

- Added `serialize` option for better control over state serialization ([PR #2337](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2337))

### Storage Plugin

- Improved SSR support with `ngServerMode` ([PR #2288](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2288))

For more information on using NGXS plugins, check our [plugins documentation](http://ngxs.io/plugins).

## Breaking Changes

While we've worked to minimize breaking changes, there are a few changes to be aware of:

- `const enum` has been replaced with regular enums for better compatibility ([PR #2335](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2335))
- The `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` has been replaced with a more efficient implementation ([PR #2314](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2314))
- Some internal APIs have changed to support the new features

If you encounter any issues when upgrading, please check our [migration guide](http://ngxs.io/) and [deprecations documentation](http://ngxs.io/deprecations).
